# Instagram Scraper

Instagram Scraper is a python command line app that scrapes your own followers' network and prepares the data to be used for social network analysis tools such as gephi.

*Instagram policies does not allow the scraping of user data. This tool is deliberately built to be "dumb", both to avoid being blocked by instagram and being used for large scale data collection purposes.* 

Scraping the followers' network of a user with 500 followers will take roughly 24h.
